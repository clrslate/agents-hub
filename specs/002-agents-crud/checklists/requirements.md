# Specification Quality Checklist: Custom Agent Management (CRUD & Model Selection)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-25  
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance intent
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (criteria established)
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] New limit requirement (FR-016 system prompt length) added with measurable SC-008

## Notes

Authentication & Authorization removed from this specification entirely (no deferred FR). Concurrency (FR-015), prompt length (FR-016), scale (10k), and other clarifications incorporated. Spec is READY FOR PLANNING for defined scope (CRUD, model selection, soft archive, validation, performance targets). Future Auth work will introduce actor identity & permission semantics without requiring spec changes here.
